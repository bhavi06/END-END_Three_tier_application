Terraform code is setting up a basic AWS infrastructure that includes a VPC, subnets, an Internet Gateway, a NAT Gateway, route tables, and a security group, all of which are common components when deploying an EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster. Below is an overview of each resource and how they interconnect.

Overview of Resources
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):

Defines a virtual network in AWS, with a specified CIDR block, DNS support, and DNS hostnames enabled.
Internet Gateway (IGW):

Attaches to the VPC to allow instances in public subnets to access the internet.
Public and Private Subnets:

Public Subnets: Associated with the Internet Gateway, allowing public internet access. They are tagged for Kubernetes with kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.cluster-name} and kubernetes.io/role/elb for external load balancers.
Private Subnets: These do not allow direct public access and are typically used for internal resources. They are tagged for Kubernetes with kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.cluster-name} and kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb for internal load balancers.
Route Tables:

Public Route Table: Routes traffic to the Internet Gateway, allowing instances in public subnets to access the internet.
Private Route Table: Routes traffic through the NAT Gateway, allowing instances in private subnets to access the internet indirectly.
Elastic IP (EIP):

Allocates a static public IP for the NAT Gateway.
NAT Gateway:

Allows instances in private subnets to access the internet by routing traffic through the Elastic IP.
Security Group:

Controls inbound and outbound traffic to the EKS cluster. The current configuration allows all traffic on port 443, but it would be better to restrict this to a specific IP range.
